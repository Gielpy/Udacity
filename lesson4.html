Common Responsive Patterns

Column drop pattern: at narrowest, objects single column; as width expands, objects become
multi-columns across

Mostly fluid pattern: stacked pattern at narrowest viewport; similar to column drop as width expands, but adds margins at the widest

see pattern-mostly-fluid-quiz!

Layout shifter: design the order!
	containers within containers!
	negative orders are possible

Off Canvas: put less frequently used off screen
	ideal for navigation menus
	<nav id='drawer'></nav>
	

	<!-- nav bar slides in from left from offscreen, covers content -->
	nav{
		width: 300px;
		height: 100%;
		position: absolute;
		-webkit-transform: translate(-300px, 0);
		transform: translate(-300px, 0);
		transition: 0.3s ease;
}

	nav.open{
		-webkit-transform: translate(0,0);
		transform: translate(0,0);
}
